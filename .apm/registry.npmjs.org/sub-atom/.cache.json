The sub-atom repo is at https://github.com/mark-hahn/sub-atom.  Feel free to ask questions at the Atom discussion group: https://discuss.atom.io/.\n\nSub-atom is a wrapper of of Atom's `CompositeDisposable` which is an Atom class that collects `Disposable` objects that enable disposing of event handlers.  `CompositeDisposable` has no provision for handling events on DOM elements.  The Atom docs say to do this for each DOM event subscription ...\n\n```coffeescript\n$(window).on 'focus', focusCallback\ndisposables.add new Disposable ->\n  $(window).off 'focus', focusCallback\n```\n\nObviously this is not acceptable for real-world code.  Sub-atom provides the class `SubAtom` which is 100% compatible with the Atom class `CompositeDisposable` but can also replace the code above with a single line.\n\n## Usage\n  \nTo install sub-atom simply use `npm install sub-atom`.  Then load and initialize the sub-atom module with ...\n\n```coffeescript\nSubAtom = require('sub-atom')\nsubs = new SubAtom\n```\n\nThe `subs` object has a function `add` that can be used exactly as `CompositeDisposable::add` is used.  An example ...\n\n```coffeescript\nsubs.add editor.onDidChange ->\n```\n\nThe same function `add` can add DOM events with this signature.\n\n```coffeescript\nsubs.add target, events, [selector], handler\n```\n\n**target:** A DOM element or a jQuery object containing a DOM element..  \n\n**events:** One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, such as \"click\" or \"keydown.myPlugin\". \n\n**selector:** A selector string to filter the descendants of the selected elements that trigger the event. If the selector is null or omitted, then only the target element can trigger the event.\n\n**handler:** A function to execute when the event is triggered. The value false is also allowed as a shorthand for a function that simply does return false.\n\nThe subs object also has a function `dispose` that disposes all added events.  This is identical to the method `CompositeDisposable::dispose`. Use ...\n\n```coffeescript\nsubs.dispose()\n```\n\n## Note\n\nWhen you call `SubAtom::add` with a native element instead of a jQuery object the handler will be called with a jQuery object instead of the native event.  You can get the native event with `event.originalEvent`.\n\n## License\n\nSub-atom is copyright Mark Hahn with the MIT license.","maintainers":[{"name":"mchahn","email":"mark@hahnca.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-02-16T00:43:19.061Z","created":"2015-01-31T19:43:59.410Z","0.1.0":"2015-01-31T19:43:59.410Z","0.1.1":"2015-01-31T21:02:50.026Z","0.1.2":"2015-01-31T22:12:56.570Z","0.1.3":"2015-02-01T01:04:01.217Z","0.1.4":"2015-02-16T00:43:19.061Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/sub-atom","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/sub-atom"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/sub-atom/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"olmokramer":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"ENDSYSJSTS44LI6UX9I24A2YD\""}
